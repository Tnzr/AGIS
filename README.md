Hello, my name is Bryan Garcia Rodriguez [Tnzr] and I'm a recent Computer Engineering Graduate from Florida Polytechnic University:

Resume: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mOsy7LR0UW7GSAwi61a57nvnLFafWwtOI7viWT2LvyU/edit?usp=sharing

Development:
The goal of this GoFundMe is to raise funds for the OpenSource development of the initial prototype of "AGIS", an Autonomous Greenhouse Irrigation System. This project will first concentrate on healthy Mycelium growth but the same exact design would also work to effortlessly grow plants.

I have 0 inventory at the moment and will work on slowly getting parts by their priority. Any contributions will greatly speed up the initial prototyping phase. After having a fully functional prototype, I will design PCBs that will eliminate most of the electrical assembly complications.

If you wish to buy the parts directly, you are more than welcome to. I have made a Parts List where you can find all related parts. There are 3 sheets in the Spreadsheet; "Minimal" contains the parts for a Basic Prototype, "Complete" contains the parts list for the Full Fledge model with all the bells and whistles, and the "Tools" sheet contains tools I can use to debug and develop easier and safer.

Mycelium Computer Vision/Machine Learning Research:
I am collecting Contaminated Mycelium pictures for Research Purposes. The goal is to use these images to train a Semantic Segmentation Classifier (Convolutional Neural Network) to spot Mycelium Contamination, ideally early enough to neutralize.

I am developing an Autonomous Greenhouse Irrigation System (codename: AGIS) which would eliminate all of the human labor involved in the fruiting process. It would maintain the Humidity levels and Fresh Air Exchange. I plan on making it so that you won't have to open the system until it is time to yield. Having a camera inside the chamber is the most logical next step and since there'll be a camera there shall also be Computer Vision involved to keep an Analytical insight into the Mycelium growing/fruiting process.

If you have any pictures of contaminated mycelium please contribute to this Dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/request/oiIYCyhibQ8bzwBHdMNE

OpenSource:
I am bringing this project to the community for 2 reasons:

This is an Open Source Project, once it is finished I plan to educate people on how to build theirs and publish all necessary info and code on GitHub. If I manage to find a good way to mass-produce it. I would sell for minimal profit margins once the project gets enough momentum for the non-DIY crowd who prefers to just buy something that suits them and works.

I have very little to no resources. Normally a company would simply pay a secondary company or their own to produce a dataset of images and then label them, but I am one person. I have just enough money to buy the parts for the first prototype, but I have no means to fund this data-acquiring part of the project.
