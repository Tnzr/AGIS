Open Source Autonomous Greenhouse Irrigation System

With a small donation of at least $1, you could further the development of AGIS, an Open-Source Greenhouse Automation Initiative that aims to provide an API (Application Programming Interface) along with a HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) to rapidly develop the needed Machine intelligence for custom models, no matter the size of the Greenhouse. From existing greenhouses to new personal custom models. Not counting food that may go to waste inside, around 40% of food is wasted before it enters the household. AGIS's mission is to help facilitate access to food and reduce wasted food by guaranteeing optimal conditions with little to no effort. AGIS aims to be an updated Database of Algorithms and Solutions related to Agricultural Machine Intelligence. There will be a Non-Profit/Benefit Business to fund the efforts of providing Autonomous Greenhouses in Places of Need once a stable version has been reached.

Hello, my name is Bryan Garcia Rodriguez [Tnzr] and I'm a recent Computer Engineering Graduate from Florida Polytechnic University:

Vision:
AGIS aims at automating as much labor from the production of vegetation and mushrooms at an affordable price. AGIS's vision is for Greenhouses to be the next standard household appliance. AGIS will have a minimal and affordable model, along with an upgraded and complete model. AGIS would make sure all conditions are optimal to prevent contamination. In addition, the upgraded model will be able to detect early mycelium contamination and monitor general plant health using Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques.

There will be a Non-Profit/Benefit Business surrounding setting up Autonomous Greenhouses in places of Need once fully developed.


Development:
The goal of this GoFundMe is to raise funds for the OpenSource development of the initial prototype of "AGIS", an Autonomous Greenhouse Irrigation System. This project will first concentrate on healthy Mycelium growth but the same exact design would also work to effortlessly grow plants.

I have little inventory at the moment and will work on slowly getting parts by their priority. Any contributions will greatly speed up the initial prototyping phase. After having a fully functional prototype, I will design PCBs that will eliminate most of the electrical assembly complications.

If you wish to buy the parts directly, you are more than welcome to. I have made a Parts List where you can find all related parts. There are 3 sheets in the Spreadsheet; "Minimal" contains the parts for a Basic Prototype, "Complete" contains the parts list for the Full Fledge model with all the bells and whistles, and the "Tools" sheet contains tools I can use to debug and develop easier and safer.

OpenSource:
I am bringing this project to the community for 2 reasons:

This is an Open Source Project, once it is finished I plan to educate people on how to build theirs and publish all necessary info and code on GitHub. If I manage to find a good way to mass-produce it. I would sell for minimal profit margins once the project gets enough momentum for the non-DIY crowd who prefers to buy something that suits them and works.
I have very little to no resources. Normally a company would simply pay a secondary company or their own to produce a dataset of images and then label them, but I am one person. I have just enough money to buy the parts for the first prototype, but I have no means to fund this data-acquiring part of the project.
